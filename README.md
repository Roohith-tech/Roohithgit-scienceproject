## Notes

**The putting-out system is a commercial arrangement where a merchant provides raw materials like yarn to weavers and receives the finished product in return. This system serves the merchant by ensuring a steady supply of cloth without having to own a factory, while the weavers are spared the expense of buying yarn. However, it creates a massive power imbalance because the weavers do not know who they are making the cloth for or what the final selling price will be. Since the merchant owns the raw material and controls the market access, weavers are forced to accept very low wages for their manual labour.**

**A cooperative is an alternative business model where people with common interests come together to work for mutual benefit. In a weaver’s cooperative, the members take over the roles of the merchant by procuring yarn themselves and selling the cloth directly to the government or big retailers. This ensures that the profit that usually goes to the middleman is distributed among the weavers. This system is one of the few ways to reduce the exploitation of small producers and ensure they receive a fair price for their work.**'

**Market inequality refers to the unfair distribution of wealth and opportunities throughout the production chain. In the journey of a shirt, the market is not a level playing field. On one end, powerful foreign business owners and garment exporters make substantial profits because they have the capital to invest in branding and large-scale production. On the other end, the primary producers like small farmers and weavers work long hours under difficult conditions but earn barely enough to survive. This inequality is driven by the fact that those who own the means of production or have direct access to the consumer have the most bargaining power.**

**The market provides opportunities for work and trade, but it does not guarantee equal earnings for everyone. While the consumer in a rich country buys a shirt for a high price, the person who grew the cotton or stitched the garment often remains in debt or poverty. This gap highlights the need for better laws and the strengthening of cooperatives to protect the interests of the poor and ensure that everyone involved in the chain gets a just share of the profit.**
